This plugin's goal is to show product quantity field in the product thumbnail after it has been added to the cart.

== Description ==

This plugin works after adding any product to the cart with woocommerce's ajax 'Add to cart' button. After adding any product to the cart from any shop loop (It can be a section of homepage or shop page), the quantity input field with a 'plus' and 'minus' will appear in the place of that 'Add to cart' button. The field won't be visible until a product has been added to the cart. From the quantity field you can then add the product in bulk just by increasing the quantity with the 'Plus' button. you can also decrease the quantity if you have added some extra by mistake. As simple as that.

This is the long description. No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

- "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wordpress.org usernames
- "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
- "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
- "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've _successfully used to test the plugin_. Note that it might work on higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
- Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for stable.

      Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so

  if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used for displaying information about the plugin. In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt` is the stable tag pointer. Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

      If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where

  you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

[markdown syntax]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:

> Asterisks for _emphasis_. Double it up for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
